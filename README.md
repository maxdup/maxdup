### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm maxdup
I'm passionate about web development, game development, digital art, and 3D printing.

### ðŸ§™ Web development
I thrive in the open-source community, with a strong passion for the Python ecosystem, particularly Flask. Crafting various extensions for Flask has driven me to prioritize code quality through rigorous testing, continuous integration, and thorough documentation.
